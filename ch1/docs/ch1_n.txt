Notation:

p = num of variables/features
n = num of observations

x_ij = value of jth variable (col) for ith observation (row)
X = nxp matrix

x_i = vector of variables for observation i (row, len = p)
x_j = vector of observations of variable j (col, len = n)

y_i = ith observation of outcome

observed data will be {(x_1, y_1), ...} (where x_i is a vector of len p)

*a* = vector of len n (always lowercase bold)
a = vector of len != n (lowercase not bold, e.g., of len p)

*A* = Matrix
A = RV (rand variable)

a \in R^k = a is nth dimensional
